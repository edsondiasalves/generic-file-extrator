Version 3.0.0
-----------------------------------------
In this version I have implemented some good practices and SOLID patterns. 
The code now are a bit more complicated to understand than the two older version, but in the other hand
we gain with extensibility and code reuse.
I have implemented unit test as well but only to cover the base aspects of the code.
In the next version new unit tests probably should be available.

Version 2.0.0
-----------------------------------------
In this version I made a big refactoring to the older code. I split the funcionalities in classes
and methods.
I tried to make the code most reusable as I can
The code are not in the ideal stage yet, but It is much more readable now.

Version 1.0.0
-----------------------------------------
In this version I have resolved all the requirements to the challenge, in the most easy way.
It works but it is not beautyfull at all
I abuse of system.linq function simply because I love them and is so easy
