Version 2.0.0
-----------------------------------------
In this version I made a big refactoring to the older code. I split the funcionalities in classes
and method.
I try to make the code most reusable as I can
There is not a ideal yet, but It is to much more readable.

Version 1.0.0
-----------------------------------------
In this version I resolve all the requirements to the challenge, in the most easy way.
It works but it is not beauty at all
I abuse of system.linq function simply because I love them
