This is the Gympass test interview

I choose write this exercise in C# bucause it was so much easy to me and because is a great opportunity to me show the way that I do most like to code.

pre requisites:
You should have Microsoft .net Framework 3.5 installed in your computer to execute the program

To execute this solution follow the steps:

I divided the stages of the development using git tags, so always that I have a new version that the code I created a new tag
